HTTP - Hyper text transfer protocol  - it is communication protocol (client-server to talk)
HTTP stateless - it means server does not remember any previous request.
previous request, user data , login state - because of this we use session, cookies and jwt token

Http request structure - Every http request have four parts - header, url , body,  method 
=>http methods
get - Fetch data
post -send data
put - update full data
patch - partial update
delete - delete data

Header - extra information
e.g. content type - application/JSON
	authorization - Brear "token"

used for authorization- data format and data caching
body content actual -Data only send by post put patch

Server Response - Status code , header , body

Node js follows event driven type architecture, We register a listener 
http module is built in and it is used to create server

createServer- a register a listener ,every incoming request

Backend never sends data as JSON(javascript object notation) 
frontend understand JSON easily




Setting  Response header
res.setHeader()
res.writeHead()
response.write() sends data as part of the response.
response.end() signals that the response is complete.

http.createServer() - Creates a new HTTP server instance
The callback function is executed for each request with two parameters:
req - The request object (http.IncomingMessage)
res - The response object (http.ServerResponse)
res.writeHead() - Sets the response status code and headers
res.end() - Sends the response to client and ends the connection
server.listen() - Starts the server on the specified port
JSON.stringify() - convert object to string
JSON.parse() - convert string to object

Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the content (e.g., text/html, application/json)
Content-Length: The length of the response body in bytes
Location: Used in redirects (with 3xx status codes)
Set-Cookie: Sets HTTP cookies on the client
Cache-Control: Directives for caching mechanisms
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: For CORS support
