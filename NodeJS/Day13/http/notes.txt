HTTP & NODE.JS – ORGANIZED NOTES

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is a communication protocol used for client-server communication.
A client (browser or frontend) sends a request and a server sends a response using HTTP.

HTTP is stateless:
The server does NOT remember previous requests.
It does not remember:

user data

login state

previous request

To maintain user state, we use:

Cookies

Sessions

JWT tokens

HTTP Request Structure

Every HTTP request has four main parts:

URL
→ The address where the request is sent

Method
→ The action to perform

HTTP Methods:

GET → Fetch data

POST → Send data

PUT → Update full data

PATCH → Update partial data

DELETE → Delete data

Headers
→ Extra information about request

Examples:

Content-Type: application/json

Authorization: Bearer token

Headers are used for:

Authorization

Data format

Caching

Security

Body
→ Actual data sent by client

Body is used only in:

POST

PUT

PATCH

Example body:
{
"name": "Rajsv",
"age": 20
}

HTTP Response Structure

Server sends back:

Status Code (200, 404, 500, etc.)

Headers

Body (data)

Node.js and HTTP

Node.js follows an event-driven architecture.
It listens for incoming requests and handles them using callbacks.

The http module is built-in in Node.js and is used to create an HTTP server.

Creating Server in Node.js

http.createServer() creates a new HTTP server.

Syntax:
http.createServer((req, res) => { })

The callback runs for every incoming request.

req → Request object (data from client)
res → Response object (data sent to client)

server.listen(port)
→ Starts the server on the given port

Request Object (req)

The request object contains all data sent by the client.

Main properties:

req.url
→ Requested path (e.g., /login, /users)

req.method
→ HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

req.headers
→ Extra info sent by client
(e.g., Content-Type, Authorization)

req.body
→ Actual data sent by client (POST, PUT, PATCH)

Purpose of req:

Read client data

Understand what client wants

Response Object (res)

The response object is used to send data back to the client.

Main methods:

res.setHeader(name, value)
→ Sets a single response header

res.writeHead(statusCode, headers)
→ Sets status code and headers

res.write(data)
→ Sends part of response data

res.end(data)
→ Sends final data and ends the response

Purpose of res:

Send status code

Send headers

Send response body

Sending Response Example

res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
res.write("Hello");
res.end("Done");

OR

res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "application/json"});
res.end("Hello World");

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

JSON is used to exchange data between frontend and backend.

Why JSON is used:

Human-readable

Machine-parsable

Lightweight

Language-independent

Easily understood by JavaScript

JSON Conversion

JSON.stringify(object)
→ Converts object to string

JSON.parse(string)
→ Converts string to object

Important HTTP Headers

Content-Type
→ Specifies data type (text/html, application/json)

Content-Length
→ Size of response body in bytes

Location
→ Used for redirects (3xx status codes)

Set-Cookie
→ Sets cookies in browser

Cache-Control
→ Controls caching

Access-Control-Allow-Origin
→ Used for CORS support

Important Points

HTTP is a protocol

HTTP is stateless

Requests contain: URL, Method, Headers, Body

Responses contain: Status code, Headers, Body

Node.js uses built-in http module

Data is exchanged using JSON

JSON is human-readable and machine-parsable

One-Line Interview Summary

HTTP is a stateless client-server protocol where requests contain URL, 
method, headers and body, and responses contain status code, headers and body. 
Node.js uses the built-in http module to create an event-driven server, 
and data is exchanged in JSON format.

REQUEST & RESPONSE OBJECT (Node.js HTTP)

When a client sends a request to the server, Node.js provides two objects:

req → request object (data coming FROM client)
res → response object (data going TO client)

Flow:
Client → req → Server → res → Client

REQUEST OBJECT (req)

The req object contains all information sent by the client.

Main properties of req:

req.url
→ URL path requested by client
Example: /login, /users

req.method
→ HTTP method used
Example: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

req.headers
→ Extra information sent by client
Example:
Content-Type, Authorization token

req.body
→ Actual data sent by client (used in POST, PUT, PATCH)
Example:
username, password, form data

Purpose of req:
→ To read client data
→ To know what the client wants

RESPONSE OBJECT (res)

The res object is used to send data back to the client.

Main methods of res:

res.setHeader(name, value)
→ Sets a single response header

res.writeHead(statusCode, headers)
→ Sets status code and headers together

res.write(data)
→ Sends part of response data

res.end(data)
→ Sends final data and ends the response

Purpose of res:
→ To send reply to client
→ To send status, headers and body

SIMPLE CODE FLOW

http.createServer((req, res) => {

// req → data from client
console.log(req.method);
console.log(req.url);

// res → send data to client
res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
res.end("Hello Client");

});

MEMORY TRICK

req = RECEIVE from client
res = SEND to client

req → what client sends
res → what server sends

“The request object contains data sent by the client, 
and the response object is used by the server 
to send data back to the client.”
